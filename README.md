# Child-Safety-Monitoring-Android-IOS-Application

The child safety monitoring Android/IOS application is made using simulink. This project was a part of our coursework for the course Signals, Systems and Random Processes.

The Child_Phone.slx contains the simulink file for the Child's Phone and the Parent_Phone.slx contains the simulink file for the Parent's Phone.
